# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 

Pewlett Hackard has a lot of employees nearing retirment age. This is going to create a considerable amount of openings. 

The purpose of this analysis is to identify the titles of the employees that will be retiring in the next few years so that management can prepare to fill the openings. We will also analyze employees that would qualify for a mentorship program to possibly take over these high level roles in the company!

## Results: Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.


## Summary: Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."

### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
- 72,459 roles will need to filled once employees born between 1952-1955 begin retiring.

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
- Yes, there are plenty of employees to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees! But they should start very soon.

### Are there enough current employees that qualify for the mentorship program to fill the roles left empty by the "silver tsunami"?
- There are 1,549 employees that are eligible for the mentorship program. This is only a very small fraction of the amount of roles that will need to be filled. The mentorship program needs to be exapanded.
